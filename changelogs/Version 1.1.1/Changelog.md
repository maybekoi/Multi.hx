### Version 1.1.1

# First of

* Do not ask about the mobile port, I'm working on fixing middlescroll first.

# What's new

* Cutscene support using hxcodec!

* Somewhat working middlescroll (just gotta make the notes themself go into the middle)

* Loading a character from a different week doesn't crash the game anymore

* Uhh modding shits

* Notesplashes

* 2 new things in the extras menu (find them lolz)

* A somewhat working crash handler (stolen from psych)

* Removed pause substate music (pretty useless + you need to pause the game for cutscenes because the song starts at the same time.)

* Somewhat better Discord RPC Support

# Bugs

* I somehow broke week 6 and uhh idk how to fix it lmao.

* Cutscenes don't stop the song from playing so uhh you gotta pause first!
